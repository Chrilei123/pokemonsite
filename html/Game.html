      <h2> The main Pokémon series </h2>
      <p> The main Pokémon series are the video games consisting of regions and gyms. Nintendo usually follows a particular
          rule when making these main games, and it mainly consists of a region, made from somewhere around the world, 8 gyms
          plus the elite four and a main legendary pokemon for each game. There's usually released two games being the same game
          but the only difference is the names being counterparts and having one different main legendary which are a part of the 
          same story.
          For example : Pokemon Ruby and Pokemon Sapphire. 
          <ul class ="noBulletsList">
              <li> <img src="../img/Games/Ruby.png" class="LegendaryStyle" alt="RubyGame" height="300" width="800"> </li>
              <li> <img src="../img/Games/Sapphire.png" class="LegendaryStyle" alt="SapphireGame" height="300" width="800"> </li>
          </ul>
          <p> The main goal of these games is to defeat the gyms, and then making your way towards the elite four.
          The game, however, is not so simple. Between recieving your first pokemon and defeating the elite four, you also have 
          many other objects and possibilities, including side stories and the main villains. Each pokemon game usually includes
          a super villain with the objective of ending the world because of their ideals. An example would be the evil leaders of
          Pokémon Ruby, Sapphire, Omega Ruby and Alpha sapphire. Based on the game you are playing, you get one of two main villains
          to defeat.</p>

          <p> This is not the case of every main pokemon game, since some of them only has one main evil villain no matter what 
          game you choose to play. If you choose Ruby or Omega Ruby, you will face maxie, who wish to capture the legendary pokemon
          in your game, and steal his powers to erupt volcanoes in the whole world so that creation starts again, and if you choose
          Sapphire or Alpha Sapphire, you face Archie. He wants the whole world to drown by using the power of the other legendary
          pokemon. However, this is the only exception, because no other main games in the series have two types of villains. 
          Luckily, the games are made so that you are able to stop this. </p>

          <h2> Poké Center and Poké Mart </h2>
          <p> <img src="../img/Games/PokemonCenterAndMart.png" class="LegendaryStyle" alt="CenterAndMart" height="300" width="800"> </p>
          <p> <img src="../img/Games/InsideCenter.png" class="LegendaryStyle" alt="InsideCenter" height="200" width="400"> </p>
          <p> This is a Poké Center. This is where you go to revive and heal your pokemon for all status effects and
              health loss. It is also where you can withdraw and deposit your pokemon into the PC. It is where you store 
              all your pokemon that you have caught. You can also go here to trade with others on the global link station
              which is a tool used to battle and trade with people across the world using your Wi-Fi. However, this did not 
              arrive until Pokemon Diamond and Pearl, so in all previous games, there is no Global Link. </p>
          <p> <img src="../img/Games/InsideMart.png" class="LegendaryStyle" alt="InsideMart" height="200" width="400"> </p>
          <p> This is a Poké Mart. This is where you go to purchase and sell items that you might need for your 
              adventures in the Pokémon world. Here you can buy potions, Pokéballs and other utilities. Some marts
              sell different things, and everything is not unlocked instantly. You will have to defeat gyms to unlock
              items, and also defeat the four elite and the champion to unlock special items after completing the
              main storyline of the game. </p>
